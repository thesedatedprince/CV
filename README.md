## Matthew Perry

I'm a former Marketing Associate and Project Manager, with a huge passion for code. In my previous marketing positions, technical SEO was always my favourite job activity, which led me to develop an interest in how websites and web apps are developed for maximum efficiency. Additionally, one of my hobbies is video game design - a passion which has naturally caused me to have a huge interest in code and desire to learn and master software development skills. I'm an INTJ personality type - independent, creative and analytical!

I'm looking for a development role where I can continue to refine and master my coding skills. My interests and ambitions mean that I'm always interested in taking on new challenges to develop my abilities.

## Skills

#### Software Development

Through Maker's Academy, I have learnt to develop software through strong TDD principles within the Agile methodology. I have developed web apps using Ruby, Javascript, HTML and CSS, and have used several frameworks including Rails and Sinatra. The Maker's curriculum encourages self-led learning, meaning that the skills I have learnt can be applied to further languages. Therefore, I am currently learning Swift by developing my own iOS game as a post-academy project.

#### Organisation

As a former Project Manager, I understand the importance of carefully planning a project and working with others to ensure it's successful completion and delivery in terms of both spec and timeframe. However, I'm also used to the fact that often unexepected obstacles can surface, which need to be overcome! I believe in an organised, methodical approach to project flow, which also allows enough flexibility for change when faced with the unexpected.

#### Communication

Having formerly worked as a client-facing staff member at a Design and Marketing agency, I'm used to working with individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds with different expecations in terms of service and delivery. I understand the importance of clear and concise communication with internal and external team members through all stages of a project, and catering my delivery based on the expectations of each individual. As part of the Makers course, I had to exclusively communicate via remote means with the rest of my project team, meaning that clear and concise communication was essential.

#### Reporting and Analysis

I understand the importance of accurate reporting at key project milestones. As both an agency and freelance marketer, I've previously put together in-depth reports covering online traffic activity, sales conversions, and close analysis of contributing factors and activities. Through any project, it's important to demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of your work, and how it leads to creating a more effective final product.
